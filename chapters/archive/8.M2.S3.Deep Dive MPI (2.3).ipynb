The default communicator `MPI_COMM_WORLD` includes all the processes launched by the MPI program.\n","\n","- **Point-to-Point Communication**: This involves the direct sending and receiving of messages between two processes. MPI provides functions such as `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv` to facilitate this communication.\n","\n","- **Collective Communication**: This involves communication patterns where data is distributed among multiple processes or gathered from them. Examples include broadcast, scatter, and gather operations.\n","\n","These concepts form the foundation for writing parallel applications using MPI.

This must be called before any other MPI function. The `argc` and `argv` parameters allow MPI to take command-line arguments if needed.\n","\n","2. **Rank and Size**:\n","   - `MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_rank);`: Determines the rank of the calling process in the communicator `MPI_COMM_WORLD`. The rank is the unique ID assigned to each process within the communicator, starting from 0.\n","   - `MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);`: Determines the number of processes in the communicator `MPI_COMM_WORLD`.\n","\n","3. **Error Checking**:\n","   - The program assumes at least two processes for this example. If fewer than two processes are available, the program prints an error message and aborts using `MPI_Abort`.\n","\n","4. **Ping Pong Logic**:\n","   - The `ping_pong_count` variable tracks the number of messages sent back and forth.\n","   - `partner_rank = (world_rank + 1) % 2;`: Each process calculates the rank of its partner process. For two processes, rank 0's partner is rank 1, and rank 1's partner is rank 0.\n","   - The `while` loop continues until `ping_pong_count` reaches 10. The processes alternate sending and receiving the `ping_pong_count` value.\n","     - **Sending**: If the current process's rank matches the current `ping_pong_count % 2`, it increments the `ping_pong_count`, sends it to the partner process, and prints a message.\n","     - **Receiving**: If the current process's rank does not match `ping_pong_count % 2`, it waits to receive the `ping_pong_count` from the partner process and then prints a message.\n","\n","5. **Finalization**:\n","   - `MPI_Finalize();`: Cleans up the MPI environment.

Let's break down the key parts of the output.\n","\n","### Point-to-Point Communication (Ring Data Exchange)\n","\n","Each process sends its data to the next process in a circular manner (ring topology) and receives data from the previous process:\n","\n","- **Process 3 sent data 103 to process 0 and received data 102 from process 2**\n","  - Process 3 sends its data (103) to process 0.\n","  - Simultaneously, it receives data (102) from process 2.\n","  \n","- **Process 0 sent data 100 to process 1 and received data 103 from process 3**\n","  - Process 0 sends its data (100) to process 1.\n","  - Simultaneously, it receives data (103) from process 3.\n","  \n","- **Process 1 sent data 101 to process 2 and received data 100 from process 0**\n","  - Process 1 sends its data (101) to process 2.\n","  - Simultaneously, it receives data (100) from process 0.\n","  \n","- **Process 2 sent data 102 to process 3 and received data 101 from process 1**\n","  - Process 2 sends its data (102) to process 3.\n","  - Simultaneously, it receives data (101) from process 1.\n","\n","This part of the output shows that each process successfully communicated with its neighbors in the ring. The data exchange is point-to-point, meaning each process explicitly sends and receives data from specific processes.\n","\n","### Collective Communication - Gathering Data\n","\n","After the point-to-point communication, the program uses a collective operation, `MPI_Gather`, to collect data from all processes at the root process (process 0):\n","\n","- **Root process 0 gathered data: 100 101 102 103**\n","  - The root process (process 0) gathers data from all processes in the communicator.\n","  - The gathered data consists of the data from each process: 100 from process 0, 101 from process 1, 102 from process 2, and 103 from process 3.\n","  \n","This output confirms that the `MPI_Gather` operation successfully collected data from all processes into the root process.\n","\n","### Collective Communication - Broadcasting Data\n","\n","Finally, the program uses another collective operation, `MPI_Bcast`, to broadcast data from the root process (process 0) to all other processes:\n","\n","- **Process 0 received broadcast data: 500**\n","- **Process 2 received broadcast data: 500**\n","- **Process 1 received broadcast data: 500**\n","- **Process 3 received broadcast data: 500**\n","\n","Here, the data value `500` is broadcasted by the root process (process 0) to all other processes. Each process receives this data and prints it, confirming that the broadcast was successful.\n","\n","### Summary\n","\n","- **Point-to-Point Communication**: The data exchange between processes in a ring topology demonstrates how processes can communicate directly with each other using `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv`.\n","- **Collective Communication - Gathering**: The `MPI_Gather` operation collects data from all processes and assembles it in the root process.\n","- **Collective Communication - Broadcasting**: The `MPI_Bcast` operation efficiently distributes data from one process (the root) to all other processes.\n","\n","This output provides a clear example of both point-to-point and collective communication in an MPI program, showcasing how data can be exchanged and distributed among processes in a parallel computing environment.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hIwEzyYucX7W"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"nQqWY3MHcYy0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
