        "\n",
        "In OpenMP, the #pragma omp task directive is a powerful feature that allows developers to express parallelism at a higher level. It enables the creation of tasks that can be executed concurrently. This is particularly useful when dealing with recursive functions, such as the computation of the Fibonacci sequence, where each task can independently compute part of the result. The use of tasks helps to exploit parallelism in irregular or dynamically structured problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using #pragma omp task, the program defines a task that may be executed by any available thread in the OpenMP team. Unlike simple parallel loops, tasks are more flexible and can be used for work that isn't easily expressed in loops.\n",

        "##Fibonacci Example Overview\n",
        "In the example provided, we calculate the Fibonacci number recursively. Without OpenMP, the recursive function would be computed sequentially. By introducing tasks using #pragma omp task, each recursive call can be parallelized, and multiple threads can execute different parts of the Fibonacci computation in parallel.\n",

        "In the serial version, the Fibonacci calculation is performed without any parallelism. This version is the fastest because there is no overhead from managing threads or tasks.

        "This version uses OpenMP sections to parallelize the recursive Fibonacci calls. Despite using multiple threads, the time is significantly slower. The overhead of creating and managing threads for each recursive call far outweighs the benefits of parallelism, especially for an algorithm that is deeply recursive like Fibonacci.\n",

        "1. Creation of Tasks:\n",

        "- Fine-Grained Control: By explicitly defining the dependencies between tasks, OpenMP can better manage task execution, ensuring correctness while still allowing parallel execution where possible.\n",

        "\n",
        "Yes, it is normal for the task-based Fibonacci implementation with dependencies to take longer in some cases, and this can be attributed to several factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Overhead of Task Management\n",
        "Creating tasks, managing dependencies, and scheduling them involves some overhead in OpenMP. Each time a task is created, OpenMP must track the dependencies between tasks to ensure that they execute in the correct order. This tracking adds some computational overhead compared to simply running everything sequentially.\n",
        "For a recursive problem like Fibonacci, where there are many small, fine-grained tasks being created, the overhead of task creation and synchronization can dominate the actual computation, especially for smaller problem sizes like Fibonacci(30).\n",
        "2. Task Granularity\n",
        "The Fibonacci function inherently has a small computational workload for each recursive call (just a few additions). However, the overhead for creating a task and managing dependencies is relatively large compared to the actual work done inside each task.\n",
        "Tasks work best when the granularity (the amount of work done per task) is sufficiently large, as the overhead can be amortized over larger tasks. For Fibonacci, each task computes only a small part of the problem, making the overhead more significant.\n",
        "3. Recursive Nature of Fibonacci\n",
        "The Fibonacci function is highly recursive, and for Fibonacci(30), this results in a large number of tasks being created. As the recursion goes deeper, the number of tasks grows exponentially, adding further overhead.\n",
        "While task parallelism can speed up certain types of workloads, recursive functions with many small tasks, like Fibonacci, may not benefit as much unless the recursion depth is very large, where more parallelism can be exploited across multiple cores.\n",
        "4. Task Dependencies\n",
        "Although dependencies ensure correct ordering, they also limit how much parallelism can be exploited. The taskwait directive ensures that tasks complete in the correct order, but it can also introduce additional synchronization points that may cause threads to wait, reducing the efficiency of parallel execution."

        "\n",
        "This example demonstrates how the OpenMP SIMD clauses `aligned` and `collapse` can be used to optimize loop-based computations by enhancing vectorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### SIMD Directive\n",
        "The `#pragma omp simd` directive explicitly informs the compiler to vectorize the loop, ensuring that multiple iterations of the loop can be executed simultaneously using SIMD instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Collapse Clause\n",
        "The `collapse(2)` clause collapses the two loops (i and j) into a single iteration space. This enables better vectorization across both dimensions of the matrix. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, where you want to optimize access patterns for both dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Aligned Clause\n",
        "The `aligned(array: 32)` clause ensures that the array is aligned on a 32-byte boundary. This improves performance by ensuring that data is efficiently loaded into SIMD registers. Misaligned memory accesses can cause significant slowdowns, so aligning the data helps maximize performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Matrix Example\n",
        "The nested loops over the matrix are vectorized with the help of the `collapse(2)` clause, ensuring that both dimensions of the matrix are processed in parallel. Each element of the matrix is multiplied by 2 using SIMD instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Array Example\n",
        "The array is processed in a single loop, and the `aligned(array: 32)` clause ensures that the array is aligned in memory for efficient SIMD processing. Each element in the array is multiplied by 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output\n",
        "The program prints a sample of the processed array to demonstrate that the SIMD vectorization was applied correctly. The matrix and array are efficiently processed using SIMD, improving performance for large data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "- **Better Vectorization**: Using the `collapse` clause allows multiple loops to be collapsed into a single iteration space, enabling better use of SIMD.\n",
        "- **Memory Alignment**: The `aligned` clause ensures that memory accesses are optimized, minimizing penalties for unaligned data.\n",
        "- **Performance**: These SIMD clauses can significantly improve performance for loop-based computations, especially when working with large arrays or matrices that can benefit from vectorized processing.\n"

        "# Introduction to Offloading to GPUs with OpenMP\n",
        "OpenMP supports offloading compute-intensive tasks to GPUs and other accelerators, which can significantly speed up certain computations. This is done using the #pragma omp target directive, allowing developers to move parts of the code from the CPU to the GPU. Offloading tasks to a GPU involves transferring data from the host (CPU) to the device (GPU), performing the computation on the GPU, and then transferring the results back to the host.\n",
        "\n",
        "In GPU offloading, data mapping is essential to manage the flow of data between the CPU and GPU. OpenMP allows developers to specify which data needs to be transferred to and from the GPU using the map clause. The map(to: ...) clause specifies data to be sent to the GPU, while map(from: ...) defines data that should be transferred back to the CPU after computation.\n",

The arrays A and B are initialized on the CPU, and then transferred to the GPU using the map(to: A[0:N], B[0:N]) clause. The result array C is computed on the GPU and transferred back to the CPU using the map(from: C[0:N]) clause.\n",

        "1. Data Mapping:\n",
        " - map(to: A[0:N], B[0:N]): This clause transfers the A and B arrays to the GPU. The GPU uses these arrays to perform the computation.\n",
        " - map(from: C[0:N]): After the computation is complete, the results stored in the C array are transferred back from the GPU to the CPU.\n",
        "2. GPU Offloading with #pragma omp target: The #pragma omp target directive specifies that the following block of code will be offloaded to the GPU. In this case, the vector addition loop is executed on the GPU, where each element of C is calculated as the sum of the corresponding elements in A and B.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Performance Benefits: Offloading to the GPU can greatly speed up compute-intensive tasks, especially when working with large data sets. GPUs are designed for high parallelism, making them ideal for operations that can be done independently on many data elements (such as this vector addition).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Sample Output: The program prints the first 10 results of the computation from the C array to verify that the GPU offloading worked as expected. The values should match the sum of corresponding elements in A and B after the computation is completed."

        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In OpenMP, **scheduling** determines how iterations of a loop are divided among threads in parallel regions. Different scheduling strategies affect performance based on the workload and the nature of the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Scheduling in OpenMP\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Static Scheduling**:\n",
        "   - Iterations are divided equally among threads at the start of the parallel region.\n",
        "   - Best for **uniform workloads** where each iteration takes roughly the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Scheduling**:\n",
        "   - Threads dynamically request new chunks of iterations as they finish previous chunks.\n",
        "   - Useful for **irregular workloads** where the time taken for each iteration may vary significantly.\n",
        "   - You can specify a **chunk size** for how many iterations are assigned to a thread at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Guided Scheduling**:\n",
        "   - Threads are initially assigned **large chunks** of iterations, and the chunk size decreases as the computation progresses.\n",
        "   - Suitable for workloads that **decrease in complexity** over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Auto Scheduling**:\n",
        "   - The **runtime** decides the optimal scheduling method based on the system and workload.\n",
        "   - This strategy is a black-box approach where OpenMP automatically handles the workload distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Purpose of This Example\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will compare the execution of a parallel loop using different scheduling strategies (static, dynamic, guided, and auto). We will print the **thread ID** and **iterations** processed by each thread to help visualize how each strategy works. This will show how threads are assigned work chunks and how the choice of scheduling can affect performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The example uses a simple loop that processes an array, and we will measure the **time taken** for each scheduling strategy to demonstrate their impact on performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Code and Output\n",
        "\n",
        "The following code will:\n",
        "- Run the parallel loop with each scheduling strategy.\n",
        "- Print the thread handling each iteration of the loop.\n",
        "- Display the total execution time for each scheduling strategy.\n"

        "- Static Scheduling is generally the best for uniform workloads because it distributes the work equally across all threads with no overhead during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dynamic Scheduling is better for irregular workloads because threads pick up new tasks as soon as they finish, reducing idle time.\n",
        "- Guided Scheduling is ideal for tasks that reduce in complexity over time, as it assigns progressively smaller chunks of work to threads.\n",
        "- Auto Scheduling lets the OpenMP runtime choose the best scheduling method based on the system and workload.\n",
        "###Try Running:\n",
        "You can try adjusting the size of the array (N) and the chunk size in dynamic scheduling to see how it impacts performance.\n",

        "## Explanation of Advanced OpenMP Features\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we progressively enhanced the serial N-body simulation using various advanced OpenMP techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Task-Based Parallelism\n",
        "We first parallelized the **compute_forces** function by creating tasks for each particle’s force computation. By using OpenMP’s tasking model, we allow the OpenMP runtime to dynamically distribute these tasks across available threads, improving load balancing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **#pragma omp parallel**: Creates a parallel region where threads can work concurrently.\n",
        "- **#pragma omp single**: Ensures only one thread creates tasks.\n",
        "- **#pragma omp task**: Each particle's force computation is assigned as a task.\n",
        "- **firstprivate(i)**: Ensures each task gets its own copy of the index `i`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Task Dependencies\n",
        "To ensure that tasks execute in the correct order, we can manage dependencies using OpenMP’s `depend` clause. This ensures that tasks computing forces finish before the tasks updating positions begin, preventing race conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Taskloop Directive\n",
        "In large simulations, creating individual tasks for each iteration can introduce overhead. The **taskloop** directive reduces this overhead by allowing OpenMP to automatically split the loop iterations into tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. SIMD Parallelism\n",
        "By adding the **simd** directive, we leverage vectorization to parallelize the inner loop that computes forces. SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) allows modern CPUs to process multiple data points simultaneously, improving performance for the loop over particle interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **#pragma omp simd**: Vectorizes the loop over particle pairs.\n",
        "- **reduction(+: bodies[i].ax, bodies[i].ay, bodies[i].az)**: Ensures that the accumulation of forces is handled correctly across SIMD lanes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. GPU Offloading\n",
        "Finally, we offload the force computation to a GPU using OpenMP’s `target` directive. This allows the program to take advantage of the thousands of cores available on GPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **#pragma omp target data map(tofrom: bodies[0:N])**: Maps the bodies array to GPU memory.\n",
        "- **#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for simd**: Offloads the force computation loop to the GPU, where it is distributed across teams of threads, with SIMD parallelization within each thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Considerations:\n",
        "- **Task-based parallelism** improves load balancing, especially for irregular workloads.\n",
        "- **SIMD parallelism** exploits data-level parallelism to improve performance within a loop.\n",
        "- **GPU offloading** harnesses the power of thousands of cores to speed up the most computationally intensive part of the simulation.\n",

        "By combining these advanced techniques, we achieve significant performance improvements, especially for large-scale simulations.\n"
