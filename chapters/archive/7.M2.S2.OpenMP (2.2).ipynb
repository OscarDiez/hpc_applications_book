        "# Exercise 7.1: Introduction to OpenMP\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is a powerful API designed for parallel programming in shared-memory environments. This exercise will introduce you to the basics of OpenMP, including how to use OpenMP directives to parallelize loops and how to manage thread parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7.1.1 Overview of OpenMP\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7.1.1.1 Definition and Purpose of OpenMP\n",
        "OpenMP provides a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications by using compiler directives, runtime library routines, and environment variables. It allows developers to parallelize existing serial code incrementally, making it easier to transition from sequential to parallel programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7.1.1.2 Historical Context and Development\n",
        "OpenMP was first introduced in 1997 and has since evolved with support for task-based parallelism, accelerator directives, and memory management improvements, making it a relevant tool in modern HPC environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7.1.1.3 Applicability in Modern HPC Environments\n",
        "OpenMP is widely applicable in modern HPC due to its ability to leverage multicore architectures efficiently. It is used in scientific simulations, data analysis, and real-time processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7.1.2 Key Features of OpenMP\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7.1.2.1 Simple and Flexible Parallel Programming Model\n",
        "OpenMP simplifies parallel programming by allowing developers to parallelize loops with minimal code changes. For example, using the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7.1.2.2 Support for C, C++, and Fortran\n",
        "OpenMP supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, and Fortran, which broadens its applicability across various scientific and engineering domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7.1.2.3 Portable Across Different Shared-Memory Architectures\n",
        "OpenMP is portable across various shared-memory architectures, ensuring that parallel code can run efficiently on different systems without modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7.1.3 Installation and Setup of OpenMP\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7.1.3.1 Installing OpenMP on Various Platforms\n",
        "- **Linux:** Use GCC with the `-fopenmp` flag to compile OpenMP programs.\n",
        "- **Windows:** Use MinGW or Visual Studio to enable OpenMP support.\n",
        "- **MacOS:** Use Homebrew to install GCC for OpenMP support.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7.1.3.2 Compiler Support for OpenMP\n",
        "OpenMP is supported by GCC, Clang, and Intel Compilers, each providing robust support for parallel programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7.1.3.3 Thread Parallelism\n",
        "Thread parallelism in OpenMP divides a task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed by multiple threads simultaneously. This approach leverages multicore processors for efficient parallel execution.\n"
