        "\n",
        "- **Processes and Ranks**: In MPI, a process is an instance of a program running on a processor. Each process is assigned a unique identifier called a \"rank.\" The rank is used to identify and communicate with other processes.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Communicators**: A communicator defines a group of processes that can communicate with each other. The default communicator `MPI_COMM_WORLD` includes all the processes launched by the MPI program.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Point-to-Point Communication**: This involves the direct sending and receiving of messages between two processes. MPI provides functions such as `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv` to facilitate this communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Collective Communication**: This involves communication patterns where data is distributed among multiple processes or gathered from them. Examples include broadcast, scatter, and gather operations.\n",

        "## MPI Ping Pong Example Explained\n",
        "\n",
        "The code provided implements a simple MPI (Message Passing Interface) \"ping pong\" program. This program demonstrates the basic concepts of point-to-point communication between two processes in an MPI environment. Below is a detailed explanation of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - `MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);`: Initializes the MPI environment. This must be called before any other MPI function. The `argc` and `argv` parameters allow MPI to take command-line arguments if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Rank and Size**:\n",
        "   - `MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_rank);`: Determines the rank of the calling process in the communicator `MPI_COMM_WORLD`. The rank is the unique ID assigned to each process within the communicator, starting from 0.\n",
        "   - `MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);`: Determines the number of processes in the communicator `MPI_COMM_WORLD`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error Checking**:\n",
        "   - The program assumes at least two processes for this example. If fewer than two processes are available, the program prints an error message and aborts using `MPI_Abort`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Ping Pong Logic**:\n",
        "   - The `ping_pong_count` variable tracks the number of messages sent back and forth.\n",
        "   - `partner_rank = (world_rank + 1) % 2;`: Each process calculates the rank of its partner process. For two processes, rank 0's partner is rank 1, and rank 1's partner is rank 0.\n",
        "   - The `while` loop continues until `ping_pong_count` reaches 10. The processes alternate sending and receiving the `ping_pong_count` value.\n",
        "     - **Sending**: If the current process's rank matches the current `ping_pong_count % 2`, it increments the `ping_pong_count`, sends it to the partner process, and prints a message.\n",
        "     - **Receiving**: If the current process's rank does not match `ping_pong_count % 2`, it waits to receive the `ping_pong_count` from the partner process and then prints a message.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Finalization**:\n",
        "   - `MPI_Finalize();`: Cleans up the MPI environment. No MPI functions should be called after this.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "- **MPI_Comm_rank** and **MPI_Comm_size** are essential for identifying the process and determining the total number of processes involved.\n",
        "- **MPI_Send** and **MPI_Recv** are basic point-to-point communication functions, used here to send and receive the `ping_pong_count` variable between the two processes.\n",
        "- **Synchronization**: The processes are synchronized via alternating sends and receives, ensuring that the ping pong count is passed back and forth correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Output\n",
        "\n",

        "## Advanced MPI Example: Point-to-Point vs Collective Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we will explore a more complex MPI example that illustrates the difference between point-to-point and collective operations. The program will use both types of MPI communication to demonstrate how they work and when each is appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The program performs the following tasks:\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - As in the previous example, the program starts by initializing the MPI environment and determining the rank and size of the processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Distribution Using Point-to-Point Communication**:\n",
        "   - Each process sends data to the next process in a ring-like fashion using `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv`.\n",
        "   - This operation mimics a manual data distribution where each process explicitly sends and receives data to and from its neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Collection Using Collective Communication**:\n",
        "   - All processes send their data to a root process using `MPI_Gather`, a collective operation that collects data from all processes and assembles it in the root process.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Broadcasting Data Using Collective Communication**:\n",
        "   - The root process broadcasts data to all other processes using `MPI_Bcast`, another collective operation that efficiently distributes data from one process to all others.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Finalization**:\n",
        "   - The program concludes by finalizing the MPI environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Detailed Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - `MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);`: Initializes the MPI environment.\n",
        "   - `MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_rank);`: Retrieves the rank (ID) of the calling process.\n",
        "   - `MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);`: Retrieves the total number of processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Point-to-Point Communication**:\n",
        "   - **Sending Data**: Each process sends data to its neighbor using `MPI_Send`. For example, process 0 sends data to process 1, process 1 sends data to process 2, and so on. The last process sends data back to process 0, forming a ring.\n",
        "   - **Receiving Data**: Simultaneously, each process receives data from its neighbor using `MPI_Recv`.\n",
        "   - This operation is highly manual, as each process must explicitly specify the sender and receiver.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Collective Communication - Gathering Data**:\n",
        "   - **MPI_Gather**: This operation is used to collect data from all processes and store it in a single root process. Each process sends its data to the root, where it is gathered into a single array or list.\n",
        "   - Unlike point-to-point communication, `MPI_Gather` simplifies the process by automatically handling the collection of data from all processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Collective Communication - Broadcasting Data**:\n",
        "   - **MPI_Bcast**: This operation broadcasts data from the root process to all other processes. It is an efficient way to distribute the same data to all processes in the communicator.\n",
        "   - The root process sends its data once, and `MPI_Bcast` ensures that all processes receive it.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Finalization**:\n",
        "   - `MPI_Finalize();`: Cleans up the MPI environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Point-to-Point Communication**:\n",
        "  - `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv` are used for direct communication between two processes.\n",
        "  - This method is flexible but requires explicit management of senders and receivers, which can become complex in larger programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Collective Communication**:\n",
        "  - `MPI_Gather` and `MPI_Bcast` are collective operations that involve all processes in the communicator.\n",
        "  - Collective operations are generally easier to use for common communication patterns, such as gathering data from all processes or broadcasting data to all processes.\n",
        "  - Collective operations are often more efficient than equivalent point-to-point operations, especially on large numbers of processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Output\n",
