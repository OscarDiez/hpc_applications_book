    "## Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The C program provided uses BLAS and LAPACK routines to perform two common linear algebra operations: matrix multiplication and solving a system of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication with BLAS (`dgemm`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The program first demonstrates matrix multiplication using the BLAS routine `dgemm`. This function performs the operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "C = \\alpha \\times A \\times B + \\beta \\times C\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `A`, `B`, and `C` are matrices,\n",
    "- `\\alpha` and `\\beta` are scalar values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code:\n",
    "- We define two 3x3 matrices `A` and `B` and multiply them to produce matrix `C`.\n",
    "- The `dgemm_` function from BLAS is called with appropriate arguments, performing the matrix multiplication and storing the result in `C`.\n",
    "- The function `print_matrix` is then used to print the resulting matrix `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving a Linear System with LAPACK (`dgesv`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the program solves the system of linear equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "A \\times X = B\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `A` is a matrix, and `B` is a vector. The LAPACK routine `dgesv` is used for this purpose, which computes the solution `X` by performing LU factorization of matrix `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code:\n",
    "- We define a 3x3 matrix `A2` and a 3x1 vector `B2`.\n",
    "- The `dgesv_` function from LAPACK is used to solve the system. The solution vector `X` (which replaces `B2` after the call) is printed using the `print_matrix` function.\n",
    "- The `dgesv_` function internally performs LU decomposition and uses the result to compute the solution. The pivot indices required for LU factorization are stored in the array `ipiv`.\n",

    "## Advantages of Using Optimized Libraries vs. Writing Your Own Code\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing complex linear algebra operations, you have two options: write your own code or use highly optimized libraries like BLAS and LAPACK. While it may seem tempting to implement these algorithms yourself for learning purposes, using optimized libraries offers many advantages, especially in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Performance**\n",
    "Optimized libraries like BLAS and LAPACK are carefully designed and fine-tuned to take advantage of modern CPU architectures. They leverage low-level optimizations, such as vectorization, multi-threading, and cache utilization, to ensure that matrix operations are performed as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Code**: Your implementation may work well for small matrices but will likely struggle with large datasets, leading to increased runtime and resource consumption.\n",
    "- **Optimized Libraries**: By using BLAS and LAPACK, you can achieve orders of magnitude faster performance for large matrices and complex operations, as these libraries are built to scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Stability and Accuracy**\n",
    "Numerical stability is a key concern in scientific computing. Libraries like LAPACK use robust, tested algorithms to ensure that operations like solving linear systems are performed with maximum precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Code**: Writing your own solver may introduce numerical inaccuracies, especially for large matrices or ill-conditioned systems.\n",
    "- **Optimized Libraries**: LAPACK's routines ensure that matrix operations are numerically stable, providing accurate solutions even for complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Scalability and Multi-node Execution**\n",
    "In HPC environments, scaling applications across multiple nodes is essential for handling large datasets. Optimized libraries like BLAS and LAPACK are designed to work efficiently on multiple processors and nodes, making them ideal for distributed computing.\n",

    "## Using BLAS and LAPACK Across Multiple Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "In large-scale HPC systems, leveraging multiple nodes can significantly reduce computation time. Many implementations of BLAS and LAPACK, such as Intel's MKL and OpenMPI, provide support for distributing tasks across multiple nodes in a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use BLAS and LAPACK with Multiple Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "When running BLAS and LAPACK operations on multiple nodes, you typically rely on MPI (Message Passing Interface) to manage communication between nodes. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MPI for Parallel Execution**: MPI is used to distribute matrix data across nodes. Each node will handle a portion of the matrix, and BLAS or LAPACK routines are used to perform the calculations locally. The results are then communicated back to the master node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: As the matrix size grows, distributing computations across nodes allows you to process larger datasets more quickly. This is particularly beneficial for tasks like matrix multiplication and solving linear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Balancing**: Libraries like ScaLAPACK (a parallelized version of LAPACK) ensure that workloads are evenly distributed across nodes, optimizing the overall computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Running BLAS on Multiple Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of how to modify your code to run on multiple nodes using MPI. We'll use `MPI_Init` to initialize MPI and `MPI_Finalize` to clean up at the end.\n"

    "\n",
    "Parallel I/O is essential in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments, especially when dealing with large datasets. In typical serial I/O operations, a single process reads or writes data, creating bottlenecks as file sizes grow. In contrast, **Parallel I/O** allows multiple processes to perform I/O operations concurrently, which significantly increases the performance of data-intensive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel I/O is especially useful when combined with parallel filesystems like **Lustre** or **GPFS**. These filesystems are specifically designed to allow many processes to read and write large amounts of data simultaneously, distributing I/O operations across multiple storage devices to provide high throughput and scalability.\n",

    "- **Redundancy**: Data is often stored redundantly across multiple disks to prevent data loss in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple processes can access the same file at the same time, significantly improving performance in distributed applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical scenario, an application running on hundreds or thousands of compute nodes in a supercomputer accesses data stored in a parallel filesystem. Instead of waiting for one process to finish its I/O operation, each process can handle its I/O independently and concurrently, improving the overall performance.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this code example, we use **MPI** (Message Passing Interface) to demonstrate how parallel I/O works. Here’s a breakdown of the key operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MPI Initialization**:\n",
    "   The `MPI_Init()` function initializes the MPI environment, enabling communication between multiple processes running on different nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Rank and Size**:\n",
    "   - `MPI_Comm_rank()` retrieves the rank (ID) of each process.\n",
    "   - `MPI_Comm_size()` retrieves the total number of processes involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Array Creation**:\n",
    "   Each process creates a large array filled with its own rank number. This simulates data generation on each process that will be written to a shared file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parallel Write Operation**:\n",
    "   - `MPI_File_open()` opens the file in **write mode** (`MPI_MODE_CREATE | MPI_MODE_WRONLY`).\n",
    "   - `MPI_File_write_at_all()` is used to perform a parallel write. Each process writes its portion of the data at a specific offset, ensuring no overlap between processes' data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Barrier Synchronization**:\n",
    "   After the write operation, `MPI_Barrier()` ensures that all processes finish writing before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Parallel Read Operation**:\n",
    "   - `MPI_File_open()` reopens the file in **read mode** (`MPI_MODE_RDONLY`).\n",
    "   - `MPI_File_read_at_all()` allows each process to read its portion of the data in parallel from the shared file.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Verification**:\n",
    "   Each process prints the first and last elements of the data it read from the file. This verifies that the data was written and read correctly in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: By allowing concurrent I/O operations, we significantly reduce the time required to perform large-scale data reads and writes.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: The code can be scaled up to hundreds or thousands of processes, leveraging the full potential of parallel filesystems.\n",
    "- **No Bottlenecks**: Since each process performs I/O independently, there are no bottlenecks caused by sequential file access, making the solution ideal for large-scale HPC applications.\n"

    "### Understanding and Interpreting Performance Profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will compile, run, and profile an MPI-based matrix multiplication program using `gprof` and `perf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compilation with Profiling Enabled**:\n",
    "   - The program is compiled using `mpicc` with the `-pg` flag to enable profiling for `gprof`.\n",
    "   - This generates a binary (`mpi_matrix_multiply`) and enables the collection of profiling data during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Execution with `mpirun`**:\n",
    "   - The program is executed using `mpirun` with 4 processes and the `--oversubscribe` option. Oversubscription allows more processes than available CPUs to run.\n",
    "   - The matrix multiplication completes, and profiling data is generated in a `gmon.out` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Profiling with `gprof`**:\n",
    "   - `gprof` analyzes the execution of the program and provides a breakdown of where time is being spent.\n",
    "   - The `analysis.txt` file contains detailed profiling data, including:\n",
    "     - **Flat Profile**: Shows the time spent in each function. Use this to identify the most time-consuming functions.\n",
    "     - **Call Graph**: Displays the call hierarchy and the time spent in both the parent and child functions. This helps understand which functions call other functions and their time cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **System-Level Profiling with `perf`**:\n",
    "   - `perf` provides hardware-level insights into CPU usage, cache hits, and system resource utilization during the execution of the program.\n",
    "   - Key metrics to interpret from `perf`:\n",
    "     - **task-clock**: Total time spent on the task.\n",
    "     - **context-switches**: Number of context switches during execution.\n",
    "     - **page-faults**: Number of memory page faults.\n",
    "     - **cycles/instructions/branches**: These metrics are crucial for understanding how efficiently the program is running on the CPU (if supported by the system).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Interpret the Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`gprof` Output**:\n",
    "  - Identify the functions with the highest time consumption. These are the bottlenecks where optimization efforts should focus.\n",
    "  - Review the call graph to see how functions interact and whether any redundant calls can be optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`perf` Output**:\n",
    "  - High context switches or page faults may indicate inefficient resource management.\n",
    "  - The `cycles` and `instructions` counters (if supported) help assess CPU efficiency. A high ratio of instructions per cycle is desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the insights from both `gprof` and `perf`, you can target both function-level and system-level optimizations to improve the performance of your MPI program.\n"

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implemented and optimized a matrix multiplication and inversion routine using MPI for parallel computation and BLAS/LAPACK libraries for efficient mathematical operations. The goal was to reduce computation time and improve performance by applying specific optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Optimized Matrix Multiplication Using Blocking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Approach:** \n",
    "The standard `dgemm` function from BLAS was used for matrix multiplication. While effective, this approach does not always fully utilize the CPU cache, especially for large matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Applied:**\n",
    "We implemented a custom version of matrix multiplication with blocking, which improves cache performance. Blocking divides the matrices into smaller sub-matrices or \"blocks\" that fit into the CPU cache. This reduces the number of cache misses and improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache Efficiency: Blocking keeps data in cache, minimizing the need to repeatedly load data from slower memory.\n",
    "Reduced Cache Misses: By operating on smaller blocks, the number of cache misses is reduced, leading to faster computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Matrix Inversion and LU Factorization\n",
    "Approach Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "LU Factorization: We used LAPACK's dgetrf_ for LU decomposition.\n",
    "Matrix Inversion: We used dgetri_ to compute the inverse of the matrix.\n",
    "Optimization Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper Memory Management: Allocated and freed memory appropriately to avoid memory leaks and ensure efficient use of resources.\n",
    "Error Handling: Included checks for failure in LU factorization and matrix inversion to handle potential issues gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### optional exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand the case study by adding more complex operations, such as eigenvalue computation or solving a system of linear equations. Profile and optimize these additional steps, and analyze how the performance scales with the problem size and number of processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### End of the practice."
